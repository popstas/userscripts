# Repository Guidelines

- Use 2 spaces for indentation in JavaScript and JSON files.
- Prefer CommonJS modules for Node.js scripts unless otherwise specified.
- Keep generated files clearly marked as such in their headers when possible.
- Update or regenerate derived artifacts (such as documentation or JSON summaries) when related source files change.
